// abstract is a concept, it's a blueprint, but you can't crate any object of this blueprint
// during inheritance we create same methods that is present inside a parent class so, what is the need of parent class
   // so make the parent class an " abstract class " so that only the concepts present.üòÅ
   // abstract class possible also method possible


// hiding the implementation details and showing only important / useful part to the user
